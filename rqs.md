##  What is ReactJS?
ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build reusable components for the view layer in MVC architecture. It is highly efficient and uses a virtual DOM to render components. It works on the client side and is written in JSX.

## Important Features of React:

1. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, ensuring fast performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
2. Component-Based Architecture: React builds UI using reusable, isolated components, making code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
3. Hooks: React hooks allow functional components to manage state and side effects, making them powerful and more flexible.


## Explain the MVC architecture.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller. Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application. It isolates the business, logic, and presentation layer from each other

## Explain the building blocks of React.

Components: These are reusable blocks of code that return HTML.
JSX: It stands for JavaScript and XML and allows you to write HTML in React.
Props and State: props are like function parameters and State is similar to variables.
Context: This allows data to be passed through components as props in a hierarchy.
Virtual DOM: It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM which makes DOM manipulation easier.

## Explain props and state in React with differences

Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The state is local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to other components.
