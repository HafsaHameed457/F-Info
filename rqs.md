##  What is ReactJS?
ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build reusable components for the view layer in MVC architecture. It is highly efficient and uses a virtual DOM to render components. It works on the client side and is written in JSX.

## Important Features of React:

1. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, ensuring fast performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
2. Component-Based Architecture: React builds UI using reusable, isolated components, making code more modular, maintainable, and scalable.
3. Hooks: React hooks allow functional components to manage state and side effects, making them powerful and more flexible.1.
